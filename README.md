# Virtual Internships
Log of Virtual Internships, Job-simulations and adjacent learning methodologies.

## What is a Virtual Internship in this context
A virtual internship is a method of learning to simulate a real world work location, where your task are focused on real world applications of skills for your career path. The end-goal is real world task skill application, in a real world settings, without the stakes of failure. Often times, the task are linked via the meta narrative of the simulation and can build upon each other as a project would. Sometimes these Virtual internships can simulate ticket systems, internal documentation and internal communication methods to round out real world experience. Oftentimes these systems can lean on gamification via leaderboards and points, to help promote learning. In rare instances, they have internal job boards with the ability to connect real world learners with job opportunities.

## My goal
Additional learning via applying theory and skills, to real world "task". While also documenting these task for other learnings, learning and potentially providing insight to my problem solving.

## To Note
Most of this repository will be focused on KodeKlouds Virtual Internships, called [KodeKloud Engineer](https://engineer.kodekloud.com/). You are free to pick two task to complete daily within your skill level, as you complete task and review others real world learners work you gain experience which progresses your "career". Allowing you to access more task, eventually progressing to mid-level and senior-level task within the scope of your 'role'. KodeKloud allows you to pick 4 skill applications at a time, to choose task from each day.

## AI and learning
AI was not used in any stage of completing, or documenting, any of these simulation task. Some of these task contain notes at the bottom of my own thoughts needed to find the solution I provide. 

While AI is a useful tool, hands-on-learning and note-taking are the best way to retain and learn knowledge. As AI is integrated into company systems, it will always need oversight and review via human-in-the-loop methodology to guarantee long term success and sustainability. These workers will still require skills and knowledge of solving problems in order to best guide any solution, AI or Human completed.
